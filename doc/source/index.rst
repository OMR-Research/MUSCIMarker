MUSCIMarker
===========

MUSCIMarker is an app that marks object locations on the page.
The name stands for "MUsical SCore Image Marker": the primary
purpose of the app is to mark locations of notation symbols
in images of musical scores. (Although it can in principle support
any kind of 2-D object marking.)

Installation
------------

The instructions are here: :ref:`installation`.

.. note:: As it stands now, we don't have installation packages that would
          work for people who don't have Python. We're working on it, though.

.. note:: You need Python 2.7 -- although most of MUSCIMarker should
          be compatible with Python 3, we haven't yet tested this. (It's fine
          if you have a Python 2 virtual environment such as conda -- see
          :ref:`installation`.)


What now?
---------

Once you install MUSCIMarker, go through the :ref:`tutorial`.
It will gently teach you how to use MUSCIMarker, and introduce the most
important concepts.

Once you are done with the tutorial, the :ref:`instructions` will
give you the details of how to annotate music notation symbols.

A complete description of what can be done with MUSCIMarker is available
in :ref:`controls`.
