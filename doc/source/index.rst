MUSCIMarker
===========

MUSCIMarker is an app that marks object locations on the page.
The name stands for "MUsical SCore Image Marker": the primary
purpose of the app is to mark locations of notation symbols
in images of musical scores. (Although it can in principle support
any kind of 2-D object marking.)

Installation
------------

The instructions are here: :ref:`installation`.

.. note:: As it stands now, we don't have installation packages that would
          work for people who don't have Python. We're working on it, though.

.. note:: You need Python 2.7 -- although most of MUSCIMarker should
          be compatible with Python 3, we haven't yet tested this.


What now?
---------

Once you install MUSCIMarker, go through the :ref:`tutorial`.
It will teach you how to use MUSCIMarker, and introduce the most
important concepts.

Once you are done with the tutorial, the :ref:`guidelines` will
give you detailed instructions on how to annotate music notation symbols.

.. The `User Manual`_ then contains details.
